after some debating and back-and-forth I think I've decided to go with a django rest api and a react front-end.

I haven't used django in a fair bit of time, so this may be a little clunky.. I'll do my best though.

I should note that I've note been purely focused on this in the past 50 mins or so - it's been more like 30 mins of work.

but anyways, I've now technically got an app using just the django and django-rest fws which can handle the basics of what's asked.. It's hardly very pretty though - hence the preference for using a react front-end instead. 

I'll just work on deploying this django app first, and then from there I'll try building up a react app which uses this django api.
