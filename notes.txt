after some debating and back-and-forth I think I've decided to go with a django rest api and a react front-end.

I haven't used django in a fair bit of time, so this may be a little clunky.. I'll do my best though.

3:15
I should note that I've note been purely focused on this in the past 50 mins or so - it's been more like 30 mins of work.

3:20
but anyways, I've now technically got an app using just the django and django-rest fws which can handle the basics of what's asked.. It's hardly very pretty though - hence the preference for using a react front-end instead. 

I'll just work on deploying this django app first, and then from there I'll try building up a react app which uses this django api.

4:10
finally got the app deploying properly, but now am getting an application error when I try and hit the endpoint through the browser -- am trying to see the heroku log to see where the app error is coming from

4:30
so I figured out that the app was 503'ing because I had no dynos allocated.
I tried to allocate dynos, but it couldn't without a Procfile,
so i'm just creating the procfile atm

4:33
finally got it to scale up to 1 dyno and successfully deploy (and not 503 when I hit the endpoint).

HOWEVER -- when I authentice and try to get in through the /admin page, or the /feedingSessions endpoint, I get a 500 "programming error" which gives "duckapi_feedingsession" does not exist.
I believe this is because the migrations haven't applied?

going to try adding "release: python manage.py migrate" to the Procfile
